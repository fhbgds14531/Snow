Snow
====

THIS GAME IS NOT 100% COMPLETE. IT WAS A HOBBY PROJECT AND THUS SOME ASPECTS RECIEVED MORE ATTENTION THAN OTHERS.

I typed out a 75 line page for this and my Internet connection ate it...

Avoid falling snowflakes. Collect the larger, brightly colored powerups. Get to the top of the screen to advance. Lives are calculated per level (this makes sense in later levels, it gets hard very slowly). Losing all lives sends you back 5 levels.

Controls:

Arrow keys: Move.
Spacebar: Change level color. (Can be useful when the rng picks dark colors)
Escape: Pause/unpause. (You can also unpause by clicking the play button on the pause menu.
